\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Objectives}

With the realization of this project, we mainly seek to understand the application of the method known as Simpson's rule both in a mathematical way by performing a practice of its use as well as in a technical way by coding the method.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

In this project we are going to calculate the area under the curve of a given segment using mathematical functions and applying the previously mentioned rule.

\section{Application of the method}

This is the general statement and proposal of the problem we are going to solve using programming and to apply Simpson's rule.

\section{Background and general information}
\subsection{Definition}

In numerical integration, Simpson's rules are several approximations for definite integrals, named after Thomas Simpson (1710–1761).

The most basic of these rules, called Simpson's 1/3 rule, or just Simpson's rule, reads:

\subsection{Previous history}

In German and some other languages, it is named after Johannes Kepler, who derived it in 1615 after seeing it used for wine barrels (barrel rule, Keplersche Fassregel). The approximate equality in the rule becomes exact if f is a polynomial up to and including 3rd degree.

If the 1/3 rule is applied to n equal subdivisions of the integration range [a, b], one obtains the composite Simpson's rule. Points inside the integration range are given alternating weights 4/3 and 2/3.

Simpson's 3/8 rule, also called Simpson's second rule, requires one more function evaluation inside the integration range and gives lower error bounds, but does not improve on order of the error.

Simpson's 1/3 and 3/8 rules are two special cases of closed Newton–Cotes formulas.

In naval architecture and ship stability estimation, there also exists Simpson's third rule, which has no special importance in general numerical analysis, see Simpson's rules (ship stability).

\subsection{Overview}

Numerical integration is the process of determining the area
“under” some function. Numerical integration calculates this area by dividing it into vertical “strips” and summing their individual areas. The key is to minimize the error in this approximation.

Here comes the Simpson's Rule, can be used to integrate a symmetrical statistical distribution function over a specified range (example: from 0 to some value x).

\section{Conclusion}

With the completion of this report, we documented in general what the simpson rule is, its definition, history, application as well as posed a problem that addresses its usefulness and set out to solve it.
