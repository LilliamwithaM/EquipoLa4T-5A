\textbf{Introduction:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
 Objectives: With the realization of this project, we mainly seek to understand the application of the method known as Simpson’s rule both in a mathematical way by
performing a practice of its use as well as in a technical way by coding the
method.
\item
Problem Statement: In this project we are going to calculate the area under the curve of a given segment using mathematical functions and applying the previously mentioned rule.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Background and general information:}
\item
Definition in numerical integration, Simpson’s rules are several approximations for definite
integrals, named after Thomas Simpson (1710–1761).
The most basic of these rules, called Simpson’s 1/3 rule, or just Simpson’s rule, reads:

Previous history
In German and some other languages, it is named after Johannes Kepler, who
derived it in 1615 after seeing it used for wine barrels (barrel rule, Keplersche
Fassregel). The approximate equality in the rule becomes exact if f is a polynomial up to and including 3rd degree.
If the 1/3 rule is applied to n equal subdivisions of the integration range
[a, b], one obtains the composite Simpson’s rule. Points inside the integration
range are given alternating weights 4/3 and 2/3.
Simpson’s 3/8 rule, also called Simpson’s second rule, requires one more
function evaluation inside the integration range and gives lower error bounds,
but does not improve on order of the error.

\textbf{Overview:}
Numerical integration is the process of determining the area “under” some function. Numerical integration calculates this area by dividing it into vertical
“strips” and summing their individual areas. The key is to minimize the error
in this approximation.

Here comes the Simpson’s Rule, can be used to integrate a symmetrical
statistical distribution function over a specified range (example: from 0 to some
value x).

\textbf{Conclusions:}
With the completion of this report, we documented in general what the Simpson rule is, its definition, history, application as well as posed a problem that
addresses its usefulness and set out to solve it.
